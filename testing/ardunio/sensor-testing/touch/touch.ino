 This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this 
 and we meet someday (Beerware license).

 Description:

 This sketch shows how to use the SparkFun AT42QT1010 Breakout
 Board. If you touch the Capacitive Touch area on the breakout
 board, the LED attached to the Arduino will light up (in addition
 to the LED on the AT42QT1010 breakout board).

 Simply connect power and ground to the breakout board,
 and the AT42QT1010 handles all the capacitive touch functions.
 By default, the board will light up the green LED when the pad
 is touched. A wire may also be connected from OUT on the
 breakout board to a digital input pin on an Arduino. This signal
 is normally LOW but goes HIGH on a touch detection. 

 The "LED Enable" solder jumper may be de-soldered in order to
 control the LED directly from the LED pin. This is useful if you
 want to light up a button that the user needs to push.
